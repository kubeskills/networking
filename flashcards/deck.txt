# Kubernetes Networking Flashcards
# Format: Question|Answer (pipe-separated for easy import)

What are the 3 main requirements of the Kubernetes network model?|1) Pod-to-Pod communication without NAT, 2) Node-to-Pod communication without NAT, 3) Pod sees its own IP (no port translation)

What does CNI stand for and what does it do?|Container Network Interface. Allocates IP addresses to Pods, creates network interfaces, and sets up routing when Pods are created/destroyed

What is the DNS format for a Service?|<service>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local → ClusterIP

What are the 4 Service types?|ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName

What does a default-deny NetworkPolicy look like?|podSelector: {}, policyTypes: [Ingress, Egress], no rules defined

How do you allow DNS in default-deny egress?|Egress to kube-system namespace on UDP port 53

What's the StatefulSet Pod DNS format?|<pod-name>.<service>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local

Why use EndpointSlices vs Endpoints?|Better scalability - 100 endpoints per slice max

Overlay (VXLAN) vs BGP networking?|Overlay=encapsulation (10-15% overhead), BGP=native L3 routing (faster)

Expected Pod-to-Pod latency?|Same node: <1ms, Cross-node: 1-5ms, Cross-AZ: 5-20ms
